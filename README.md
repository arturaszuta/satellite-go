# Satellit

Satellit is a web application which we built for Space Apps Waterloo Challenge - 2019. It is an educational app which helps you learn more about satellites. Based on your location in gets information of all the satellites which are above you and then provides data(satellites name, launch year, exact coordinates and description). You're also able to add satellites to your collenction if you'd like to revisit them later.
